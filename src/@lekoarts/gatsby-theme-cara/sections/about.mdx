## About

> Inspired by modern, sleek designs of the ever-changing tech scene, I strive to help companies and individuals find an enhanced online presence and reach a greater audience. 

At former companies including Ernst & Young and Digital Assets, I had the opportunity to dive into several backend projects where I collected 
real-time data from APIs, displayed the information in an easy-to-read format, enhanced the security of sensitive information, and quickly 
cleaned excel data files of monthly employee reports with AI tools (Django, Python, Pandas AI). I've been complimented by leaders and co-workers for my organization, patience under pressure and 
dilligence to meet project guidelines under tight deadlines. I also care deeply about software to help those with disabilities and look 
forward to new innovations to make everyday life simpler!
